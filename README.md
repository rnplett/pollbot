This bot is an experimental bot based on botkit from devnet.cisco.com

To run this bot use the following command line fromat:
ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXX PUBLIC_URL=YYYYYYYYYYYYY node helloworld.js

The package list is a bit excessive and could be trimmed significantly. One of the hazards of borrowing the package list from Webex's botkit.
